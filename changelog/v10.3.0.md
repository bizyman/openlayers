# 10.3.0

In addition to many important bug fixes, the 10.3 release adds several improvements to the recently introduced `ImageTile` source, support for model transformations for the `GeoTIFF` source, a new `SentinelHub` source, built-in support for UTM coordinate transforms, smart caching of regular shape and icon styles, TypeScript improvements for the `VectorImage` layer, and a new `WebGLVectorLayer`.

### Upgrade notes

#### The `transform` function throws for unknown projections

Previously, the `transform()` function from the `ol/proj` module would apply the identity transform if either the source or the destination projections were unrecognized. Now this function will throw an error if it cannot perform the transform. You can check whether a projection is registered by calling the `get()` function from `ol/proj` - this function returns `null` if the projection definition for a provided identifier is not known.

#### The format of the style for `WebGLPointsLayer` has changed

Such a layer would previously be created this way:
```js
// Before
new WebGLPointsLayer({
  style: {
    // variables were part of the `style` object
    variables: {
      minYear: 1850,
      maxYear: 2015,
    },
    filter: ['between', ['get', 'year'], ['var', 'minYear'], ['var', 'maxYear']],
  },
  source: vectorSource,
})
```

From this release on, **variables are now set as a separate object** at the root of the options object:
```js
// Now
new WebGLPointsLayer({
  style: {
    filter: ['between', ['get', 'year'], ['var', 'minYear'], ['var', 'maxYear']],
  },
  variables: {
    minYear: 1850,
    maxYear: 2015,
  },
  source: vectorSource,
})
```
